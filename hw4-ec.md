# Extra Credit

In this extra credit assignment, we will further explore the concept of floating point representations. In particular, you will

1. Design appropriate floating point representations considering various functional (precision, range, etc.) and non-functional (performance, memory footprint, compatibility, etc.) requirements
1. Evaluate floating point representations according to various functional and non-functional requirements

in the context of machine learning systems. **Note that you do NOT need to know any machine learning to successfully complete this assignment.**

The extra credit is worth a total of 100 points. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us during office hours or post your questions on the `Ed Discussion` forum.

# Assignment

## Part 1: Design (50 points)

Training and running modern machine learning models, such as ChatGPT, requires performing billions, trillions, quadrillions or even quintillions of floating point operations. By analyzing the unique workload imposed by machine learning, it's possible to design more efficient floating point representations than the IEEE standard `float` and `double`. 



## Part 2: Implementation and Evaluation (50 points)
